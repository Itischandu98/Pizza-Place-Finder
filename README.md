# Pizza-Place-Finder
Program to find the nearest pizza place (to build a compass)

can enable these google APIs for free from https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library? and go to setting and find the API Keys and enable restrictions as necessary and you can find the respective documentations as well. It also has the application to different Programming Languages.

This program uses the google maps api to find the nearest Pizza Place from the location it can also be used to find any location in general by changing few parameters.

Saw a video in youtube by google and thought of doing it (needed a Module which has internet access and GPS connectivity to build one and few leds).
